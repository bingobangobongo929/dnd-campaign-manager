# Random Tables Research

> Research on whether random tables fit our "planning beyond the table" mission.

## Key Finding

**Random tables ARE widely used**, both for prep and at-table. However, the community consensus is:
- **Heavy randomization = PREP** (build tables, roll for inspiration)
- **Light/quick reference = at-table** (quick lookups)

This fits our mission when framed as **"build your prep toolkit"**.

## When People Use Random Tables

| Use Case | Timing | Fits Our Mission? |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Breaking creative ruts | Prep | ✅ Yes |
| Generating NPCs/names | Prep | ✅ Yes |
| Building encounter tables | Prep | ✅ Yes |
| Creating custom loot tables | Prep | ✅ Yes |
| Quick at-table improvisation | Session | ⚠️ Grey area |
| Combat dice rolling | Session | ❌ VTT territory |

## What People Roll For

Most common uses (ranked):
1. Random encounters
2. NPC generation (names, traits, motivations)
3. Treasure/loot
4. Names (people, places, taverns)
5. Locations
6. Plot hooks
7. Weather
8. Travel events
9. Dungeon features

## Current Tools Landscape

| Tool | Has Random Tables? |
|------|-------------------|
| **World Anvil** | ✅ Yes - full featured, linked to content |
| **Kanka** | ❌ No native feature |
| **LegendKeeper** | ❌ No, recommends external tools |
| **D&D Beyond** | ❌ No, despite years of requests |
| **Donjon** | ✅ Dedicated website for this |
| **Roll20/Foundry** | ✅ VTT features |

**Gap in market:** Kanka, LegendKeeper, D&D Beyond don't have this. World Anvil does and markets it.

## Recommendation

**Include random tables, positioned as prep/planning tool.**

**Scope:**
- Create custom tables during prep
- Link results to campaign entities (NPCs, items, locations)
- Pre-built templates for common uses
- Community sharing (future)

**NOT competing with:**
- VTT dice rolling for combat
- Real-time session mechanics

**Differentiator:** Integration with campaign content. Rolling on your loot table returns actual items from your item database, not generic results.

## How It Works (Rough)

1. DM creates "Wilderness Encounters - Neverwinter Wood" table
2. Adds entries: Wolves (weight 3), Bandits (weight 2), Dragon (weight 1)
3. Entries can link to: encounter entries, NPC entries, etc.
4. During prep: DM rolls, gets "Bandits" linked to their Bandit Captain NPC
5. Uses result to plan session

**The value:** Not just random generation, but random generation that pulls from YOUR campaign content.

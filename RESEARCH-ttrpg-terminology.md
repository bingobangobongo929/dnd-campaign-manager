# TTRPG Terminology & Module Structure Research

> This document captures research findings on TTRPG terminology and professional module structure.
> It serves as a reference for planning the campaign management system improvements.

## 1. Terminology Definitions

### Campaign
The broadest term - a series of connected stories played over multiple sessions with the same group of player characters. Like a TV series with ongoing narrative.

- **Typical Length**: 6 months to 2+ years
- **Session Count**: 10-70+ sessions
- **Levels Covered**: Often spans multiple level ranges (1-10, 1-15, or 1-20)

### Adventure
A set of game sessions united by characters and narrative sequence, setting, or goal. A single storyline or quest with defined beginning, middle, end.

- **Typical Length**: 1-9 sessions
- **Can be**: Part of a larger campaign OR standalone
- **Scope**: Single narrative arc with one primary objective

### Module
Specifically a **pre-written, published adventure**. Term originated with TSR's early D&D publications. Today used interchangeably with "adventure" for published content.

- **Format**: Historically thin publications, modern ones are hardcover books
- **Always**: Pre-written/published content (not homebrew)

### One-Shot
Self-contained adventure designed for a single session.

- **Typical Length**: 2-4 hours (single evening) or 6-9 hours (full day)
- **Characteristics**: Complete story arc, often pre-generated characters, no ongoing commitment

### Adventure Path
Series of interlinked adventures forming a full campaign, published in sequential installments. Popularized by Paizo (Pathfinder).

- **Format**: Typically 3-6 monthly publications
- **Standard**: Six 96-page softcover books forming continuous storyline
- **Level Range**: Usually 1-20

### Anthology Collections
Collections like **Tales from the Yawning Portal** containing multiple adventures tied thematically. Can be run as standalone, side quests, or progressive campaign.

## TEACHER ENRICHMENTS (from Session 9)

### Leila Pence
**Source:** Session 9 - time skip training section

> "Spending time with Leila you learn that she was born with a gift, the gift to step into the inbetween, she'd done it subconsciously when she was sleeping as a child, it was a gift that went down through the women in her family, though she hadn't stepped a foot into the inbetween for many years now."

> "She was from a prominent family in Chico, who'd been drafted into Allycans academy in the same city. She'd thrived and set out with a small team herself in their third year, where they'd visited an orphanage outside Automvale which was plagued by what the children called 'The Boogeyman', it turned out to be a very powerful and vengeful spirit, killing the kids one by one."

> "She'd stepped into the inbetween to get a better look at him, bringing with her two of the other students. She was the only one who got back out.. Since that day, he seemed to have followed her, she'd hear him at night.. It took her a while but she managed to create an item that allowed her to be invisible to the lost souls of the inbetween, as long as she stayed out of it. She later moved up north to Terron, to make sure he wouldn't just find her by accident."

**Add to Leila's profile:**
- description: Born with the gift to step into the in-between (runs in family). Lost two students to "The Boogeyman" spirit at an orphanage near Automvale. Created an item to stay invisible to lost souls. Moved to Terron to hide from the spirit that follows her.

### Brea "Dean" Aman

Here she spent years, serving as protector and rising in ranks over the years. She spent time getting into the politics of the place, later sitting in council meetings with Mr. Allycan himself and established a good relationship with him."

> "She mentions the male dominated environment and that raising up in rank as a female wasn't easy, what she never directly tells you, but you understand, is that sometimes when the odds are against you, you might need to create better odds for yourself."

> "You get an understanding that Brea's intentions are good, she had nothing and understands how that feels, she dreams of a better world for the family she was taken from when sent to the Dark Wardens program, she wants a better world for the kid she once was."

### Alistair "Cupcake" Killigan
**Source:** Session 9 - Alistair's speech to Faust

> "Listen closely you two. There's a big difference between fighting people and fighting monsters. Monsters are predictable. They hunt, they kill, but they're driven by instinct, hunger, or territory. People, though... they're driven by fear, ambition, desperation. They think, they plot, and they'll stab you in the back when you least expect it. Monsters may tear at your flesh, but people can tear at your soul. Never forget: the most dangerous creatures you'll face are those who wear a smile."

**Add to Alistair's profile:**
- quotes: "Monsters may tear at your flesh, but people can tear at your soul. Never forget: the most dangerous creatures you'll face are those who wear a smile."

> "As a young adult, she'd made a deal with Castiel the Vampire lord of Rovenia and he'd turned her. Years later, still merely a vampire-spawn she'd grown tired of the leash that came with her powers/condition. She got in contact with Mr. Allycan, the most influential and powerful man in Rovenia, in exchange for his help in killing Castiel, allowing her to deal the final blow, she'd serve him, do his bidding and he had agreed to the deal. Val was enrolled at the Academy where she'd stay whenever Allycan didn't need her."

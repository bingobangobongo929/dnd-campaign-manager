Anastasia Callahan

Backstory

The smoke and screams from the pyre never reached Anastasia’s sense, she was too young to remember it, but it shaped her life all the same. Her mother was accused of witchcraft in a small village outside Talabheim and burned at the stake when Anastasia was still a baby. Her father, Egon, a priest of Morr, took Ana and fled into the crater city, where stone walls and Morr’s rites offered the safety the countryside never would.

Years later, when Ana began to take after her mum, showing unmistakable signs of magic, Egon realized it’d only be a matter of time before his daughter would meet the same fate as his wife, unless he found her way to keep her safe. Through his work he met Baron Rainer Feuerbach and struck up a deal, Rainer would pay for a proper mentor for Ana to master her magic, and in return Ana would serve as the Baron’s mage when she’d finished her training. A safe future, Egon called it.

Her mentor, Giselbert Almayda, one of the famed Talabheim Eleven, wasn’t the pretentious wizard she expected. He was sharp, patient, and oddly kind, and over time he became a friend as much as a teacher.

Getting bored of running in the same hamsterwheel she called life, she started slipping out at night, chasing tavern noise and bad ideas. That’s where she met Jaime de Sabatin, who found her magic and penny, her ferret familiar, very useful in his line of work. Ana helped him often enough to profit, and told herself it was harmless.

When her training ended, she joined Baron Feuerbach as promised. The job was pure boredom: standing behind him, silent and unseen, while he barely acknowledged she existed. The only entertainment was learning his secrets as he let his guard down around his “furniture.” Eventually she decided she’d rather risk consequences than rot in someone else’s service, so day she just left, no note, no goodbye, just left.

She reunited with Giselbert, he offered her shelter of a different kind: the Hexenguilde. A hidden circle that could protect her if the Baron came hunting, and a discreet place to shift the “interesting” items Jaime’s work turned up. Ana accepted useful, flexible, not as suffocating as a noble’s leash, though commitment was never her strength.

These days she makes friends the way she makes trouble..

Early life

Anastasia was born in a small village outside Talabheim. Her mother was accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake when Anastasia was very young.

Her father Egon, who was and still is a priest of Morr, fled with baby Ana to Talabheim inside the crater, where Morr’s rites and order offered a kind of shelter and structure away from the superstitious village folk.

The “good path”

When Anastasia started showing clear magical signs, her father panicked and does what he believed through his faith would be best: control the risk.

Through one of his services, Ana’s father met Baron Rainer Feuerbach, who he made a deal with, he sponsors a mentor to Ana and in exchange she will serve as a mage for him, securing Ana a safe future.

Student life: the cracks

Ana gets a mentor, Giselbert Almayda, one of the big talebheim 11, but he turned out to not be a pretentious as she thought he would and they became good friends

She started sneaking out, drinking, chasing excitement, becoming friends with a particularly bad influence by the name Jaime de Sabatin, who finds her familiar, a black ferret called she calls Penny and magic powers very useful in his line of work. She helps him out now and then, profiting her as well.

Adult life: The new and the boring

After finishing her tutoring with Giselbert, she joins Baron Rainer as his bodyguard, which entailed him ignoring her existence, her being the quiet shadow making sure nothing happens to him, absolutely boring. She did come to learn a lot about him, given that for the most time, it felt like Rainer forgot about her existence, which let to him letting his guard down around her, she observed of his private life.

Then one day, she decided her life was better lived away from the Baron, so she just left, no notes, no nothing, just left and returned to Giselbert, explaining her situation he invited her to become part of the Hexenguilde, which could server as a place of shelter, should she ever need to hide from trouble.

The Hexenguild also served as a very useful place to sell magic items she would get through Jamie.

How she bonds with the PCs

Morten: She spots someone who sits alone and seems well-behaved and decides it’s practically her civic duty to corrupt him. “One drink. One night out. One little sin.” during her time as a studen’t she’d often visit him, brining food and drinks, other times taking him to the local tavern and getting him into fights

Jon’s PC: The tavern becomes their base. Anastasia is the regular who always pays late, tells stories, starts fights, and somehow always walks out smiling.

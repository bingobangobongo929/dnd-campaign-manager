Emerlin Reeves

Once upon a time, a baker named Emily and a blacksmith named Challas fell in love, dreaming of a large family with both boys and girls.

Though they weren’t wealthy, they lived comfortably. Soon, they welcomed their first child, a boy named Emmet. A year later came Ethan, and the following year, another boy, Elias. As the years passed, the three boys grew up, while their parents continued to hope for a daughter.

When the eldest was nearly a teenager, Emily and Challas were finally blessed with a girl, Emerlin. Their home was happy, but the parents’ attention often focused on Emerlin. The boys loved their sister but began to feel the absence of their parents’ affection.

As they grew older, the boys took on chores, gathering firewood, moving flour, and helping their father at the blacksmith’s. Emerlin, meanwhile, played and had fun, with few responsibilities. Resentment grew among the brothers.

By the time Emerlin reached young adulthood, the boys openly resented her—not for who she was, but because their parents seemed to adore her without requiring much from her, while they had to work hard for the family.

One evening, the boys suggested a night out at the tavern to celebrate Ethan’s birthday. They promised to look after Emerlin, but it was a lie. They took her to the harbor and sold her to a ship looking for someone to assist the cook. Late that night, they told their parents she’d been taken and that they’d done all they could to save her. Broken-hearted, their parents wept, and seeing their pain, the boys felt terrible—but it was too late to undo.

The ship Emerlin was sold to turned out to be a pirate vessel. She started in the kitchen, scrubbing floors and sharpening weapons, but soon grew close to a young crew member named Noah, who taught her to fight with a rapier. She became part of the crew, joining in on drinking, fighting, and sharing stories.

For a time, they sailed and plundered freely, targeting noble ships, trading vessels, and even other pirates. But one day, they encountered a better-armed pirate crew. Most of her comrades were killed, and the last thing she saw before falling into the water was Noah fending off an attacker.

Emerlin eventually washed ashore near a small fishing village. She took odd jobs to survive, hoping other crewmates might also have survived—especially Noah. Alone and longing to see them again, she set off for nearby coastal towns, hoping to find any familiar face. Along her journey, she met (Frodo’s character), who became a close friend and travel companion.

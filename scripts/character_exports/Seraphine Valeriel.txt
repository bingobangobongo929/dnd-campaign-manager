Seraphine Valeriel

Backstory

Seraphine was born to a human father and a siren mother under the astrological sign of (insert sign here). Her parents died mysteriously when she was just a toddler. Fortunately, the Aresian military happened to be in the area at the time. (Insert name), a high-ranking member of the Aresian council, found Seraphine and took pity on her. Having never had the time to find a partner or have children of his own, his duty always coming first, he decided to adopt her and raise her as his own daughter.

From the moment she could walk, her father began training her in military discipline, determined that she would follow in his footsteps. Due to his rank and influence, no one dared to question his decision to bring a half-siren into Aresia. As long as he was around, people showed her respect, whether genuine or out of obligation. But as she grew older and began training under other military personnel alongside her peers, the tolerance of others wore thin. The cold shoulders and whispered insults became constant.

"Sing us a song, why don’t you? It’s what your kind do. Don’t pretend you belong among fighters and warriors."

Threats about cutting off her wings to make her look “less freakish.” Suggestions that she should leave and never return. But Seraphine had built a deep bond with her father and refused to let him down by giving up.

Despite the hostility, she pushed through and excelled in training, finishing at the top of her squad—exactly as her father had hoped. However, her success did little to improve her standing among her peers. Many, especially Trishera, who had finished just below her, resented her. Trishera had been jealous ever since, making it her personal mission to make Seraphine’s life miserable. The rest of the squad largely sided with Trishera, believing Seraphine’s success was due to favoritism rather than skill.

Tensions finally boiled over after a long mission. As they made their way back to Aresia, the squad decided to stop at an inn about a day's travel from the city. While Seraphine had only one drink, the rest of the squad drank far too much, letting loose in ways they wouldn’t dare to back home. Drunk and reckless, they began picking on a blind traveler at the inn.

Seraphine stood up for him, forcing the others to back off. She helped the stranger to his room, treating a small bump on his head and offering her apologies for her squad’s behavior.

When she confronted the squad afterward, their drunken inhibitions let their true feelings spill out. The insults were sharper than ever, their resentment laid bare.

"You don’t belong here."

"We’d be better off without you."

Seraphine backed away. She could have fought them, but she didn’t want to. Not like this.

The next morning, she made her decision. She left the squad behind and departed with the blind traveler, choosing instead to help him on his quest to recover artifacts that could cure the curse placed upon him.

New friend - Meeting Astar

Seraphine was on her way back from a successful mission with her military squad of seven. Their task had been to escort a shipment of valuable goods to a city deep in the heartlands—far from home. Now, just a day's journey from Aresia, they stopped for the night at an inn. The squad, eager to celebrate a job well done, quickly got carried away with their drinking. Seraphine, however, knew better than to drink herself into oblivion.

As the night progressed, her squadmates grew rowdy, singing, dancing, and irritating the other patrons. They eventually turned their attention to a man sitting alone, a blindfold covering his eyes. At first, they simply taunted him, shoving him lightly and laughing, but despite his inability to see, he seemed ready to retaliate. The situation escalated when one of the soldiers, in an attempt to climb onto the bar, lost his balance and accidentally struck the blindfolded man in the face with his mug.

The man hit the floor with a dull thud, blood trickling from his eyebrow where the mug had struck him. He quickly got to his feet, muttering in irritation, “It’s about time someone put a stop to your idiocy.” He looked ready to lash out, but before he could, Seraphine stepped in.

With practiced efficiency, she yanked one soldier off the bar, knocked another unconscious, and shoved two more away. “Enough,” she commanded, her voice sharp with authority. “You were trained better than this. Don’t make me report your behavior to the council.”

Her threat was enough to make them back down. Grumbling, they stumbled outside to cool off.

Turning to the injured man, she knelt beside him, offering a sincere apology. “If you’d like to issue a formal complaint, I can provide our squad number. You’d be entitled to compensation.” As she spoke, she dusted him off, examining his wound. “Let me take care of that eyebrow, I have a healing kit in my room upstairs.”

The man nodded and held out his arm. Seraphine understood the gesture and gently took hold, guiding him up the stairs. Once inside her room, she helped him sit on the bed and retrieved her kit. “This will sting a little,” she murmured, preparing the alcohol. “But I’m pretty good with a needle.”

As she cleaned his wound and began stitching, she realized she hadn’t introduced herself. “Oh, I'm Seraphine. I should have mentioned that earlier.”

“Astar,” the blind man replied through clenched teeth, enduring the pain.

“It’s nice to meet you, Astar,” she said sincerely. “I’m sorry about the circumstances.” Hoping to distract him, she asked, “What brings you to the inn?”

Astar explained that he was searching for artifacts to cure a sickness. Seraphine listened attentively. Once she finished stitching, she carefully replaced his blindfold. “All done,” she said. “Again, I’m sorry. Let me help you to your room—and I’ll cover your breakfast in the morning.”

Astar nodded in gratitude, allowing her to lead him to his quarters. Once alone, he exhaled, feeling more at ease. He cracked open the window to let in the cool night breeze—only to overhear voices outside.

Seraphine had rejoined her squad, but the conversation was anything but friendly.

“Who do you think you are, freak?” one of them sneered. “You’re not our superior.”

“You’re lucky we didn’t beat you down along with your crippled friend,” another added.

“We’d be better off without you,” a third voice hissed. “Dead or gone—I don’t care. You don’t belong here.”

Seraphine said nothing. The insults continued until, eventually, someone stormed back inside, slamming the door behind them. The ensuing silence told Astar everything—Seraphine had walked away.

He shut the window, mulling over whether the soldiers deserved a lesson. But for now, he packed his belongings, wrapped himself in three blankets, and drifted into uneasy sleep.

A gentle knock at the door woke him.

“Hey… are you awake?” a familiar voice asked softly.

Astar groaned, rolling out of his blankets and fumbling for his clothes before opening the door. “I am now.”

“Perfect. Grab your things, we’re leaving.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Leaving?”

Seraphine hesitated. “I… I’ve decided that, as an apology for yesterday, I’ll help you find your artifacts.” Then, as if sensing his doubt, she quickly added, “I already spoke to the others. They agreed it would be a fair way to make amends.”

Her voice wavered toward the end, a lie. Astar might be blind, but even he could recognize a poor attempt at deception. He chose not to call her out on it.

“I’ll be down in a minute,” he said simply, shutting the door with quiet deliberation.

And so, with the first light of dawn, they set out together.

Session 1

Seraphione and Astar arrived at a tavern in Astoria during the late evening hour, where we were supposed to meet Kira, who works for the Oracle(?).Talking to Kira she might actually be the god Kira, but doesn’t admit to it.She wants the party to prove themselves as heroes, though Seraphine is no hero, just a soldier.

They go to fight the bore and slay it, next up will be to sacrifice it to some god, though Seraphine and Astar is quite sceptic about the whole sacrificing as well.

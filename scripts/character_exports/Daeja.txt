Backstory Prompt: Anything can of cause be adjusted to fit in better with the world.

Daeja is the product of the queen's infidelity with the commander of the kings guard. When she was just a baby it was no problem hiding the fact she wasn’t really the kings child, however, as she grew older the resemblance to king became more.. Noticeable… or was the queen just paranoid and afraid someone would find out?

The queen ordered her secret lover to stage a kidnapping of Daeja and take her far away to a safe place where she could grow up safely, where no one would find out about the affair. The commander of the kings guard took her away during the night before her 7th birthday. He settled down with her in Ruby’s Creek under the pretence of being her uncle.

Being experienced with weapons, her uncle started teaching her archery, he took her out camping and hunting in the forests around the village and encourage her worldly curiosity.

At 25 she spends the most time outside, the forest terrain feels like her second home and with the crops and livestock around the village being killed, she was lucky if she could even shoot a squirrel. People are hungry and most nights, her uncle and her would go to bed hungry, having donated what little they could catch in the forest to the sick and struggling villagers.

One morning before heading out, she noticed her uncle was missing, it didn’t look like anyone had broken in, some of his clothes and belongings were missing, took what little food they had and his sword, but no message was left behind, it was like he just got up and left which was… unusual for him… Where did he go?

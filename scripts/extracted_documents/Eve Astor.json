Her vision of the justice system is very squared, if you commit a crime you should be punished for it. She’s very proud, however, she's not as good of a fighter as her sisters and is bringing more shame to the family than her parents like. She’s travelling out to better herself and make her parents proud by perhaps trying to bring down a known criminal who stole from the village or make a name for her family perhaps? To prove herself and bring her family honour",

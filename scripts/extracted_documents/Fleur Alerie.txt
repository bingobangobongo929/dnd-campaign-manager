👩‍🏫Fleur Alerie🕵️‍♀️

Sheet: https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/Sorreia/characters/46456198

Background:

Fleur’s memory of her parents is distanced with no real feelings attached. Her dad is a travelling merchant, her mom got sick shortly after her birth and passed. Her dad left her in the care of a dear friend of the family, Bertrand. Bertrand is an antiquarian of magical ancient artefacts and had often purchased artefacts from Fleur's dad. Bertrand took Fleur in as his own and taught her about magic and wizardry, she became his personal assistant and helped him through his studies of these special artefacts. In her early teen years, Bertrand got his hands on “The ring of futures'' (Or something else?) and one night he had put it on. Ever since then it would whisper to him and he’d slowly begin to lose his mind. It didn’t take long before the powers and whispers became too much and he’d had to leave the estate in order to protect Fleur.

Bertrand left her a note and a map to a cloister nearby where she could go and be taken care of, given his reputation he knew they’d help her. She spent the next few years trying to find a way to break the course of the ring… Swore she’d try to save the man she considered her dad.

# Legal Landscape for TTRPG Campaign Tools

> Critical reference for what content is legally safe to include.

## The Short Version

**Safest approach:** Be completely system-agnostic like Kanka and LegendKeeper. Provide organizational tools, let users input all game content.

## What Happened with OGL

- **OGL 1.0a (2000)**: Open Gaming License let third parties use D&D mechanics
- **OGL 1.1 Controversy (Jan 2023)**: WotC tried to change terms, massive backlash
- **Resolution**: OGL 1.0a remains, SRD 5.1 released under **Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0**
- **CC-BY-4.0 is irrevocable** - Wizards cannot take it back

## What's in the SRD (Can Use with Attribution)

If we want to include D&D content, SRD 5.1/5.2 content is usable with proper attribution:

**Included:**
- Core rules and mechanics
- Classes: Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
- Races: Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Human, Dragonborn, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Tiefling
- Many spells, feats, equipment, magic items
- Many (not all) monsters

**Required Attribution:**
```

## How Competitors Handle This

| Tool | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **Kanka** | Completely system-agnostic, no game content |
| **LegendKeeper** | Completely system-agnostic, no game content |
| **World Anvil** | System-agnostic, users add their own content |

**Common patterns:**
- Provide organizational tools only
- All game content is user-generated
- Clear terms that users are responsible for their content
- DMCA takedown procedures

## Recommended Approach for This Project

### Option A: Fully System-Agnostic (Safest)
- No built-in D&D content
- Generic templates (Character, Location, Item, etc.)
- Users input all game-specific data
- Support multiple game systems

### Option B: SRD Content with Attribution
- Include SRD races, classes, spells, monsters
- Proper CC-BY-4.0 attribution throughout
- Still cannot use Product Identity
- More useful for D&D users, slightly more legal risk

### Required Disclaimers

**Fan Content Policy (if allowing user content):**
```
[App Name] is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy.
Not approved/endorsed by Wizards of the Coast. Portions of the materials
users may include are property of Wizards of the Coast.
```

**General disclaimer:**

## Alternative: ORC License

The **Open RPG Creative License (ORC)** is an alternative developed by Paizo:
- System-agnostic, perpetual, irrevocable
- Supported by Paizo, Kobold Press, Chaosium, Green Ronin
- Provides safe harbor independent of WotC

Could support multiple licenses/systems rather than just D&D.

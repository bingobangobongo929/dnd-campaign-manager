4. **Character Tracking** - Stats, inventory, backstory
5. **Search/Navigation** - Quick access to any information

## Design Implications

### Progressive Disclosure Model
Rather than "beginner" vs "expert" modes, features should reveal progressively:

**Always Visible (Core)**
- Campaign name/description
- Characters (simple list)
- Sessions (notes)
- Basic NPCs

**Visible When Relevant (Intermediate)**
- Factions (when first faction created)
- Timeline (when first event added)
- Maps (when first map uploaded)
- Relationships (when first relationship created)

**Advanced (Opt-In)**
- Hex crawl tools
- Clue networks
- Political relationship matrices
- Scheduling integration
- Multi-GM coordination

### Template-Based Onboarding
Offer campaign templates that pre-configure the UI:
- "First Campaign" - minimal features, guided setup
- "Dungeon Crawl" - maps prominent, encounter tracking
- "Story Campaign" - story outline, NPC focus
- "Sandbox" - hex map, faction territories
- "Mystery" - clue tracker, timeline
- "Political" - faction web, relationship matrix
- "West Marches" - scheduling, shared state

User can always add/remove features regardless of template.

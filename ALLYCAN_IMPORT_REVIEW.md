**Source:** Player document + Miro board

**Miro Board Text (preserved exactly):**
> The House Ha'an-Vodusas descended from Zariel, ruled Solaria for 300 years, promised the region protection against hellspawn to lure locals into submission. The family enslaved and killed thousands, until one day they retaliated against the family. The family was defeated and the family was all killed except the two children Ravyn and her little brother Drago.
> Drago was taken away.
> Ravyn was taken in by a paladin called Landon who played a big part in freeing the people of Solaria from Ravyn's family.
> Ravyn learned the ways of the paladin.
> She is on a secret quest to uncover and destroy a demonic artifact linked to their family's past, which has the potential to unleash great evil. Landon revealed it to her some years before entering the Academy but she has no leads about it yet because everything that has to do with her family was destroyed during the insurrection. (The crown of command - A crown that can take control over people/enslave their minds, this was used by her family to take over Solaria)

**From Player Document (player's voice):**
> She found herself in a locked cell in a dark and damp dungeon underground and was left there alone. But sunlight peeks through a tiny hole on the upper corner of a wall where she saw the sky and her mother and father in the middle of a tiny clearing, surrounded by an angry mob. They were on a pedestal, towering over the people, their hands bound and their necks hung by a rope.

> And most days, Ravyn just longs for acceptance and friendship, for her life to be normal.

> Ravyn grew kind-hearted and soft-mannered, with bright eyes and great hope for the future.

#### 7. LYNNDIS "LYNN" GRACE
**Source:** Player document + Miro board

**Miro Board Text (preserved exactly):**
> Lynndis 'Lynn' Grace / Amelia Miriam O'Malley
> [Connected to Umberlee]

> Umberlee: Goddess of the sea. Took Lynn's heart so she could walk the earth. Is viciously jealous of Lynn's mom's reputation on the sea and wants to destroy her reputation and take her down.

**From Player Document (player's voice):**
> "Look closely, darling, because today's lesson is important. Life is like a whirlpool, dragging down the weak and unwary until their own inadequacies and failures drown them. All you can do is swim and resist the pull by succeeding again, and again, and again. For those who fail, this is all that awaits." - Miranda to Lynn

> The next thing she knew, she was drowning with a piece of jagged wood jammed in her chest. The remains of the merchant ship were sinking around her and a massive creature with the toothy maw of a shark and squid-like tentacles was looking down at her.

> When she woke up, she was on a rock in the middle of the ocean. The wood had been pulled from her chest and, in its place, was a massive, black pearl right where her heart should be. When she tried to call out for help, she also learned that she could no longer speak.

# Research: Player Contributions

> What do players actually want and use in campaign management tools?

## Key Finding

**Players want agency over THEIR character, but don't want responsibility for world content.**

Even when given full wiki editing access, most players don't use it.

## What Players Actually Use (High Value)

| Feature | Usage | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Private character notes/journal** | High | Personal character development |
| **Shared party inventory** | High | Usually Google Sheets |
| **Session recaps** | High | Whether writing or receiving |
| **Their own character page** | High | Backstory, relationships, personality |

## What Some Players Engage With (Medium Value)

| Feature | Usage | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Contributing backstory NPCs/locations** | Medium | When explicitly invited |
| **Collaborative worldbuilding** | Medium | West Marches style campaigns |
| **Commenting and theorizing** | Medium | Usually in Discord, not tools |

## What Players Ignore (Low Value)

| Feature | Usage | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Editing wiki articles** | Low | Even when given permission |
| **Complex contribution interfaces** | Low | Too much cognitive load |
| **Formal approval workflows** | Low | Prefer informal channels |

## How Competitors Handle This

### World Anvil
- Writers can create drafts only (GM publishes)
- Advanced Writers can edit their own articles
- Editors see ALL secrets (no middle ground)
- **Journals feature** for in-character prose
- **Notebook** for 100% private player notes

### Kanka
- Per-entity permissions (granular)
- Players can be given access to specific items
- Journals tied to calendars
- Commenting features for theories

### LegendKeeper
- Real-time multiplayer editing
- Players modify their character pages
- Whiteboards for brainstorming
- Secrets hidden from players

### Obsidian Portal
- All players can edit all wiki pages by default
- "It's actually really difficult to motivate players to add/edit pages"

---

## The Reality

> "Tried Obsidian Portal to give my Players a place to organize their information but they didn't really use it much"

> "Over-organizing can overwhelm players; keep things on a need to know basis"

**Most groups use:** Google Sheets, Google Docs, Discord - because it's simple and familiar.

## Recommendations for Multiloop

### Focus On (High Value)
1. **Character ownership** - Player fully controls their character page, backstory, journal
2. **Simple shared resources** - Party loot, quest log from player perspective
3. **Session recaps** - Player-written recaps valued by DM
4. **Character journal** - Private in-character notes

### Consider (Medium Value)
1. **Player-contributed backstory NPCs** - With DM approval workflow
2. **Player theories/speculation** - Simple comment or note system
3. **Rotating recap responsibility** - Encourage player engagement

### Don't Over-Build (Low Value)
1. Complex wiki contribution systems
2. Formal approval queues for player edits
3. Player-editable world lore

## The Core Design Principle

**Make player contribution OPTIONAL and LIGHTWEIGHT.**

- Players who want to contribute can (their character, backstory NPCs)
- Players who just want to consume can (read DM's content)
- Don't make players feel obligated to maintain content
- DM always has final say

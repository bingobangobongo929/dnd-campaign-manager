| **appearance** | 🤖 AI INFERRED (from heritage) | *Ravyn bears the unmistakable marks of her Zariel lineage - the tiefling features that remind everyone she meets exactly who her family was. Despite her kind eyes and gentle manner, her appearance inspires fear and hatred in those who remember the 300-year reign of terror.
